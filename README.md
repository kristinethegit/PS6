# PS6 Information

The data is called UAH-lower-troposphere-long.csv, which is esentially giving us information about the temperature and region over the course of the years (starting with 1978 through 2023).

The top slidebar panel controls the plot, allowing us to control how many scatterplot dots we want to see on our graph. Each dot represents the year and temperature, helping us see the pattern of climate change.

The bottom slidebar panel controls the table, helping us organize the table by putting the 'Year,' 'Month,' or 'Day' in numerical order for our eyes to navigate the dataset with more ease.
